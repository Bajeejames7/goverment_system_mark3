Remove the following files and all related code:

Client:
- client/src/lib/firebase.ts
- All firebase-related imports and usage in client/src/lib/auth.ts
- All firebaseUser references in client/src/pages/Login.tsx

Server:
- server/firebase-admin.ts
- server/supabase.ts
- All firebase-related code in server/routes.ts and server/storage.ts

After removal, refactor authentication and storage to use only Aiven or your preferred provider.
