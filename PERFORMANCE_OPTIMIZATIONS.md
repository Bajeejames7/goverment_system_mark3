# Performance Optimizations for Government System

This document summarizes the optimizations implemented to address the `[Violation] 'setTimeout' handler took Xms` warnings in the government system.

## Issues Identified

1. **Heavy Data Processing**: Multiple `useQuery` hooks fetching data simultaneously in the Letters component
2. **Document Preview Performance**: PDF previews using iframes can be resource-intensive
3. **Authentication Context Operations**: Complex timeout logic with event listeners in AuthContext
4. **Database Queries**: Potentially unoptimized queries for large datasets
5. **Lack of Caching**: Missing cache headers for API responses

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. AuthContext.tsx
- Added debouncing to the activity timer function to prevent excessive calls
- Used passive event listeners for better performance
- Improved timeout cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### 2. Letters.tsx
- Added `useMemo` hooks to memoize expensive calculations
- Optimized query settings with appropriate `staleTime` and `gcTime` values
- Implemented filtered letters memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added performance optimizations to API request handling

### 3. DocumentPreview.tsx
- Memoized file extension calculation, file icon, file type, and file size formatting
- Memoized preview content to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added lazy loading for iframes
- Optimized component rendering with useMemo

### 4. queryClient.ts
- Added performance optimizations to API requests with keepalive option
- Improved query configuration with optimized refetch settings
- Added network mode optimizations for mutations

### 5. server/routes.ts
- Added cache headers for API responses to reduce server load
- Implemented performance headers middleware
- Added caching strategies for folders and letters endpoints

### 6. server/storage.ts
- Added limit to getAllLetters query to prevent performance issues with large datasets
- Maintained existing optimizations while ensuring data integrity

## Expected Improvements

These optimizations should address the setTimeout violation warnings by:

1. **Reducing Main Thread Blocking**: Memoization and debouncing reduce the amount of work done on the main thread
2. **Improving Cache Efficiency**: Proper cache headers reduce redundant API calls
3. **Optimizing Event Handling**: Passive event listeners and debounced handlers reduce overhead
4. **Preventing Memory Leaks**: Proper cleanup of timeouts and event listeners
5. **Enhancing Data Loading**: Optimized query settings reduce unnecessary refetching

## Monitoring

After implementing these changes, monitor the console for:
- Reduction or elimination of `[Violation] 'setTimeout' handler took Xms` warnings
- Improved rendering performance in the Letters table
- Faster authentication context initialization
- Better document preview loading times

## Additional Recommendations

1. Consider implementing pagination for large datasets
2. Add virtualization for long lists/tables
3. Implement code splitting for better initial load times
4. Use React Profiler to identify additional performance bottlenecks
5. Consider implementing Suspense for better loading states
